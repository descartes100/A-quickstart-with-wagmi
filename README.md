# A quickstart with wagmi

[wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) is a collection of React Hooks containing everything you need to start working with Ethereum. wagmi makes it easy to "Connect Wallet," display ENS and balance information, sign messages, interact with contracts, and much more â€” all with caching, request deduplication, and persistence.

This is a Dapp frontend built with React and wagmi. Check the [Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/58iOalxN3U4) for further explanation.
